📊 Data Analyst Job Market Analysis
📌 Project Overview
•This project analyzes over 2,000 Data Analyst job postings to understand salary trends, required skills, and overall job market patterns.
•The objective is to perform end-to-end data analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and basic salary prediction modeling.

🎯 Problem Statement
•Analyze salary distribution across job roles and locations
•Identify key technical skills required by employers
•Understand sector and company-based trends
•Attempt salary prediction using basic regression models

📂 Dataset Description
•The dataset contains job postings with the following features:
•Job Title
•Salary Estimate
•Location
•Company Rating
•Company Size
•Industry & Sector
•Job Description

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
•Removed duplicates and handled missing values
•Cleaned salary estimates and created Average Salary feature
•Extracted technical skills such as Python and Excel from job descriptions
•Converted relevant features into numerical format for modeling

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•Key insights from analysis:
•Salaries vary significantly by job title
•Certain locations offer higher average salaries
•Sector-wise distribution shows concentration in specific industries
•Company metadata (rating, size, founded year) has limited impact on salary
•Data visualization was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🤖 Modeling Approach
•To predict average salary:
•Baseline Model – Dummy Regressor
•Linear Regression Model

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics:
•Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
•R² Score
•Both models performed close to the baseline (R² ≈ 0), indicating weak relationships between salary and the selected numerical features.

📌 Key Learning
•The modeling results show that salary prediction using basic company metadata is difficult. Salary appears to be influenced more by:
•Job role
•Location
•Market demand
•This project highlights the importance of exploratory analysis and realistic model evaluation over forcing predictive performance.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
•Python
•Pandas
•NumPy
•Matplotlib
•Seaborn
•Scikit-learn
•Jupyter Notebook

📎 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from raw data cleaning to insight generation and modeling. While predictive performance was limited, the exploratory insights provide meaningful understanding of the Data Analyst job market.
